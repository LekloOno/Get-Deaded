# [Display FPS](display_fps.gd)

`extends Label`  
Pretty self explanatory. It is a label node that displays the current frame rate at runtime.
Place it, as is, anywhere visible.

# [Grounded](Grounded.cs)

`extends Label`  
A label node that explicitly displays if the player is grounded or not.

# [Speedometer](Speedometer.cs)

`extends Label`  
A label node that displays the current player's velocity in km/h.  
Do not confuse it with [UI_SpeedoMeter]() which is explicitly used as part of the user interface, and typically has more effects aboard.
