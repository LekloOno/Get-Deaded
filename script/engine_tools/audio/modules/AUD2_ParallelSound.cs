/// Specialization of AUD_RandomSound that runs each new stream Play on a parallel channel. <br/>
/// <br/>
/// Modification to its relative volumeDb and pitchScale still applies to all channels, but relatively to their own initial volumeDb and pitchScale. <br/>
/// This is the default behavior for volumeDb, but modifying the pitch scale of a player usually don't affect polyphonic stream. <br/>
/// The node provides a way to achieve it while maintaining independant base pitch. <br/>
/// <br/>
/// Setting the Stream of an AudioStreamPlayer stops all its currently playing sounds. AUD_RandomSound would suffer from this in cases where we need to repeatedly play. <br/>
/// AUD_ParallelSound is thus also relevant if avoiding this issue is necessary.
