---

This folder contains a generic curve sampler definition and various implementations to simplify common data transformations. For example, clamping input to a specific range and normalizing them to a different scale and distribution.

# Usage

The curve sampler are Godot resources, that you can easily create and attach to any Node.

Then, in-code, you can retrieve the transformed output by calling -
```cs
T input = ...;
T output = _curveSampler.Sample(input);
```
