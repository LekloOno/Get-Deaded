~~Coyotte time but for ground ?~~
    ~~- Having a slight margin, like 30-50 ms in which friction is not applied after landing~~

~~Jump should override grounded state to prevent friction to apply~~

Handle properly the velocity cache.

Prevent Crouch clipping

~~Implement Slide~~

~~Add Slide force~~
~~Make so velocity is not projected on floor plane when sliding (slides faster downward, slower upward)~~

"Hold" Property on crouch should be bound to slide's.

Lerping is now frame rate independant, maybe use a similar method for the drag ?

~~Slide Force Decay~~

~~Dash~~

Can get a lot of height with the dash, should maybe nerf that.
