~~Coyotte time but for ground ?~~
    ~~- Having a slight margin, like 30-50 ms in which friction is not applied after landing~~

~~Jump should override grounded state to prevent friction to apply~~

Handle properly the velocity cache.

Prevent Crouch clipping

~~Implement Slide~~

Add Slide force
~~Make so velocity is not projected on floor plane when sliding (slides faster downward, slower upward)~~
